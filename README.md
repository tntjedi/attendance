# attendance
so this is basically a code that helps you determine your attendance 

the data you need for this code is
-The amount of classes you have attended 
-The total number of classes that have happened till now (yes including the ones you missed)

this code will show you attendance and will tell you the number of classes you can miss/ need to cover up before you go below/above the minimum required criteria (yes you can enter min. criteria). :)
